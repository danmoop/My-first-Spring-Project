# My-first-Spring-Project

# I have a @Controller file - located in Main/src/main/java/com/tspring/Main
# And there I have Visit.java file to track visitors.
# Then I created new ModelAndView and send this data to index.html - located in Main/src/main/resources/templates
# For first time not bad  I think
